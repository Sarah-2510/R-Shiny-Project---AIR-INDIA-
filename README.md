# R-Shiny-Project---AIR-QUALITY INDEX-

## Data 
### Link To The Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india 
We have taken the dataset from Kaggle. This data is publicly available by the Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) which is the official portal of the Government of India

### About The Data 
The dataset consisted of approximately 30,000 rows with data for 26 cities and 12
different pollutants contributing to the air quality Index (AQI) over a time span of 5
years i.e;2015-2020.

### Pre-Processing
The time period chosen was 2017-2019. Then , the cities with highest variation in AQI levels 
were filteres out. The missing values were treated using linear interpolation. After pre-processing, roughly 
8540 rows and 14 columns were left.  

## Introduction 

### Project Aim 
The project aimed at analysing Air Quality Data for various cities in India over a time
period of 2017-2019. The project analyses the same data in multiple ways using different
statistical tools and visualization tools to derive insights from the changing trends over
years.

## Conclusion 
Through these graphs and statistical tools, it was seen how AQI has changed over the 
course of years and which pollutant is the most significant contributor to a given city. In nearly all the 8
cities that were  analysed, the quality of air was low.
